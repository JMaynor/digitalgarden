Inspired by a couple other people I follow doing similar lists around the end of the year, I wanted to write out what all I'm using service and app-wise in my daily tech and media life.

I've been generally trying to self-host more things while also eliminating unneeded apps from my phone and computer. Moreso to save on unnecessary subscriptions, but I also appreciate a simpler setup. Or one that is less prone to corporate whims. So if year-to-year this list substantially changes, I'll write a followup.
