[Dolores](https://github.com/JMaynor/Dolores) is a python-based Discord bot that does a couple of different things. Primarily she is used for some simple randomization commands to facilitate DnD. She also has some other functionality I've added over time. Mostly whatever random thing has occurred to me that would be useful to have at the time. Playing music in voice chat. Some things related to the streaming schedule. So she is somewhat targeted towards my vertical, but my intent over time is to make her more universally useful.
