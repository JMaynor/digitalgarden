# Review

Very fun. Loved seeing who [[Clark Gable\|Clark Gable]] was. I had no idea he was Bugs Bunny. Super charismatic, as Bugs is ought to be. It did have some early comedy bits. As in there was extended periods of not-funny. (Not *bad* per se, just not really funny and also not being like super dramatic. Just extended pauses where we're kind of plodding along doing stuff.) There was a nice heart to the movie, though. I'm deeply confused by the rights of women. Like, does the father just own her? We're sending men to steal her away, that can't be ok, can it? She's not a child or anything. Was it really that bad if you're unmarried?

Also, love the literal most nothing movie title I have ever seen in my life. You hear "It Happened One Night". What *even* does that mean?
