# Review

Second viewing of Clockwork Orange, and still quite good. I love the effect that the set design has. It was one of the most notable aspects of the movie to me, actually. It's almost oppressive with its weird mishmash of English-Eastern European griminess with its colorful sexual liberation decorations. [[People/Stanley Kubrick\|Stanley Kubrick]] is definitely one of my favorite film directors.
