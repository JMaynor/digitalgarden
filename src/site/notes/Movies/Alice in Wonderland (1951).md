# Review

Curioser and curioser indeed. Alice was always a little too episodic for me to latch onto. So it's never been a huge favorite of mine, even if all the actual visuals are iconic. Not the new one, obviously. We aren't talking about that nonsense. But it was good in general. Dodo is my favorite. He was easily the best. Although the Queen herself is a great villain. I did find myself just wanting to see more of her. One of the most notable things I picked up on, that stupid child me did not. Is that Alice is more insane than any of the people she's around. She fully has no grasp of what is happening and blindly chases the White Rabbit for reasons that are not entirely clear to me.

I've heard a number of explanations over the years of what Alice in Wonderland is actually *about*. That's it's about imaginary nuumbers in math. Or some such. That all seems silly to me. It just feels like some silly nonsense that a dreaming child would come up with. I haven't read the original book, so I cannot say myself. But it just seems a bit far-fetched. I did like that Disney fully had me watch a bunch of children get eaten by an English businessman right in front of my eyes. Of the songs, Flower song was the best, I was feeling some Disney magic there.

Magicâœ¨? There
