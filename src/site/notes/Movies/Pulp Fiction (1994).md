# Review

I feel weird reviewing Pulp Fiction because it's just one of those movies that everyone knows. So instead, I won't. In general, I like Tarantino's films. He's not one of my favorite directors or anything but of his movies that I've seen, I thought they were good. Reservoir Dogs is my personal fave. I like the subversion of the plot starting only once the heist is already over. Also, as has been stated on previous occasions, I like movies with small settings/bottle episodes.

Generally, I think the thing that draws me to Tarantino is his dialogue. People feel like people and talk like people. I don't like his whole thing with the n word though. Like I just imagine him gleefully smiling while writing the script. He tee-hees, kicks his feet about, and says "Whoops, looks like another slipped in...oh no..."
