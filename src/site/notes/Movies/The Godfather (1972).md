# Review

Predictably excellent. No great surprise there. I did occasionally find my mind wandering. It's good, but a lot. Michael scares me with his empty empty eyes. Vito is such a strange character. Ostensibly a bad person, you know crime lord and all that. But comes across as a saint compared to Michael. I know the movie is about Michael, but Vito really is interesting to watch. And another excellent performance from [[People/Marlon Brando\|Marlon Brando]]. Good to see a nice side from him after we saw him as the extreme bastard in [[Movies/A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)\|A Streetcar Named Desire]] and the scary scary philosophical man in hell in [[Movies/Apocalypse Now (1979)\|Apocalypse Now]].
