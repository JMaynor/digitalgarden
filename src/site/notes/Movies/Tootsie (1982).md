# Review

Good seeing [[People/Dustin Hoffman\|Dustin Hoffman]] again after [[Movies/All the President's Men (1976)\|All the President's Men (1976)]]. He's rather talented, look at the range there in just those movies alone. Tootsie's life stressed the hell out of me. I was almost desperate for it to come crashing down. Loved the reveal scene.
