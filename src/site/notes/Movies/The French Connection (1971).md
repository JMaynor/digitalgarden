# Review

I think I like 70s movies. There's just something about them, at least the ones that I've seen that have this feel to them. I'm not sure what it is exactly. Could very well be a selection bias. I'm unlikely to have seen too many bad 70s movies. More likely those that I've seen are the particularly good ones that have survived the test of time. But even so.
