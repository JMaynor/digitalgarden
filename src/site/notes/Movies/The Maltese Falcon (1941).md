# Review

[[People/Humphrey Bogart\|Humphrey Bogart]] is great. Have loved every movie we've seen him in. And they've all been such completely different performances! He's got range. Also have loved all the other John Huston films. Huston really hits, huh? I greatly enjoy getting to know these legendary directors and coming to appreciate their work myself. People who names I vaguely was aware of but couldn't tell you anything about their films.

This was at a break-neck pace. The movie flew along. Was very exciting, and great performances all around. I love the image at the very end with the falcon staring at us, judging...
