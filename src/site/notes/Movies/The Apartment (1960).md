# Review

Wholly unexpected film. Was not remotely what I was expecting it to be. I was incredibly surprised when Fran wasn't waking up in Baxter's apartment. All I saw was the basic plot summary from the Wikipedia intro and "romantic comedy" (missing the drama portion of it). I had mostly discounted it and was a bit disappointed we were watching yet another romantic comedy for the list. But I was quite happy to see how deep some of these characters were. Everyone was surprisingly multifaceted. Partially because I went in expecting a comedy, but even then. Sheldrake is obviously the villain but he's not like maniacal or anything. And everyone else is just regular people. No one was wholly unreasonable, either. Even with the wacko premise.
