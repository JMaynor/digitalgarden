The American Film Institute has a list, **AFI's 100 Years... 100 American Movies**, of the 100 greatest American movies of all time. The list was most recently updated in 2007. Alex and I been going through the whole list and watching each, skipping just a couple due to having seen them plenty of times before and not needing to watch them again. Linking my thoughts on each.
