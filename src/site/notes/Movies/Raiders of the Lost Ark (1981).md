# Review

Lots of fun, great movie. We ended up deciding to watch all of the Indiana Jones movies since it had been some time since either Alex or I had seen them. Shockingly violent given the PG rating, But some interesting history there, in that it is one of the movies that necessitated the invention of PG-13. Even then, though the movies *feel* like they should be family friendly and then sometimes people will just suddenly become red. Temple of Doom in particular was very dark and violent. I didn't like [[People/Steven Spielberg\|Steven Spielberg]]'s vision of India, I didn't wanna be there. But it was great fun fighting the Nazis in Raiders.
