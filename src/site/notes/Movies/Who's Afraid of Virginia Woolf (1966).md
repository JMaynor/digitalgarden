# Review

I fucking adored this. I can't believe I hadn't really heard much about it before. Especially after all the sugar I've talked about [[Movies/12 Angry Men (1957)\|12 Angry Men (1957)]]. Absolutely everything was to my liking. Acting was phenomenal, the camera angles and positioning of the characters felt so dynamic. The pacing, my christ. Standing goddamn ovation.
