# Review

Normally I would not have particularly cared for Shane. But I was really primed to be fine with a western after the several real depressing movies we've had in a row. And it was indeed fine. The landscapes were gorgeous and a clear standout of the film. America is beautiful indeed. I quite liked that there ended up being comparatively little rooting and tooting and cowboy shooting. It was nice to mostly just have characters interacting. Alex and I both agreed that Shane exuded Bethesda protagonist energy. One who is taking a break from the main quest to piss about doing some random whatever before getting back to the ol' dusty trail.
