# Summary

# Review

Interesting game, deeply deeply depressing. Even when, I think, it's trying to present a silver lining. Like it was genuinely depressing enough that it was bumming me out at times. Made all the more effective because of its cartoony exterior. I enjoy this company and I will probably be following them after [[Games/Call of the Sea (2020)\|Call of the Sea (2020)]] and this.
