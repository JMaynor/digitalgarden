# Summary

# Review

I think this is still my favorite COD. Again, surprisingly fun. I really enjoyed the sense of heroism married to the commitment to keeping you on the ground and in the thick of it. You're not some supersoldier, you're just some guy. But you're playing a small and important part in something much bigger.
