# Summary

# Review

Visage was great, one of my fave horrors. I think Rakan chapter was the clear weak link. I wouldn't get rid of it, but I liked the Dolores and Lucy chapters a lot more. I think my biggest problem with it is that we leave the house for most of it. The clever ways the designers get you to learn the (wacko) layout of the house and then mess with it in each of the chapters is one of my favorite aspects of the game. So leaving the house for a large portion of the chapter seems a bad idea to me. Would've been much more effective if the house is half-warped into a hospital.

Game had really memorable visuals overall. The infinite stairs sequence in the Dolores chapter. The hell sequences in the mirror mask bits. The "friend" enemy in Lucy's chapter. Just some parts of it that stood out in my memory. The game does make me wish I could have played PT, or *could* play it in the future...
