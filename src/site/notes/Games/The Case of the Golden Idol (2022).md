# Summary

# Review

Far and away the most detective game I've ever detective'd at. I enjoyed that it properly asked me to deduce. Most detective or detective-adjacent games don't really do that. They go through the motions, but they never really ask you to understand what is happening in front of you. I think of L.A. Noire and how you're really led right down the order of events.

I don't have an infinite appetite for games like this, but it was a rare gem and quite enjoyable. Will definitely play the sequel when it comes out.
