# Summary

# Review

I think about this one often. It didn't completely work for me. There's parts that I think go on a bit too long. The intermission where you're watching the show. It went on so long I started skipping dialogue. But it was overall very enjoyable and felt so original. Like I was experiencing something I never had before.
