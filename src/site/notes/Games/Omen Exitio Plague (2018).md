# Summary

# Review

Fun VN. I feel the ending I got was a bit overly bleak. Even if accurate to Lovecraft and all. It did feel a bit wrong to go through all that and make a deal with the cosmos and it ends up all for naught. I found out later that I seemingly made all the worst possible choices, so that's fun. I suppose I would rather get the bleakest ending than a middling one.

I do want to see what else this company does, and there should be another Omen Exitio coming in the future. We'll have to pretend that ending didn't happen when we get there.
