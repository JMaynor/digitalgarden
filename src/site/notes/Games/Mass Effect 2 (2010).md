# Review

Next up, Mass Effect 2. The clear front-runner of the series. And yet, also the one that has some of the least to do with the overall plot. Hmm...curious. This came up during William's playthrough of either Mass Effect 2 or 3, but if Mass Effect ever gets a TV show, I don't want a recreation of the games. I don't fucking need that and if other people say that they do, they can get fucked and learn to replay a game, if that's what they really goddam want. No, what I want is a slice-of-life workplace comedy about the experiences of the crew on the Normandy. The thing that Mass Effect excels at is in its feeling of camaraderie. That is what you focus on, if you were ever adapting it. I think that would be great. Imagine, just off to the side you have Shepard being Shepard, but what we the viewer get to see is Greg and Bob going on about the new Blasto. I am *telling you*...Nobody understands my genius. Anyway ME2 best.
