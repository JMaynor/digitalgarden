# Summary

# Review

Easily one of my favorite horror games. So so good and anxiety-inducing. And so much care was clearly shown. The world of the game, Sevastopol station, is so well-realized with its details drawn directly from the films. The sound design in particular I would draw attention to. The noises the alien makes fucking about in the vents make you sweat. I was very glad to have played it.
