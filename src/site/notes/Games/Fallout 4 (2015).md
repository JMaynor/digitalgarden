# Summary

Fallout 4 is an action RPG (I mean...) developed, published, envisioned, manifested, and summoned into reality by Bethesda in 2015. The fourth (I mean...) game in long-running series of post-apocalyptic romps, in Fallout 4 you play as the "Sole Survivor". The sole survivor of Vault 111. This time we find ourselves in Boston, a stone's throw away from DC proper.

I've played Fallout 4 before soon after it first released, but I didn't gel with it at the time. That being said I've been wanting to do a Fallout and it is the clear choice to cover. I love New Vegas and much prefer it over 3 and so I decided I wanted to give 4 a fair chance, loading it with mods to buff out the dents. Join me as we bring the powerful spirit of America back into the world!

# Links

TODO Expand on mod list, don't want it to just be a link somewhere. Want to have the list here as a table potentially. Mod name and link to it. Perhaps also version number if we're feeling extra.
