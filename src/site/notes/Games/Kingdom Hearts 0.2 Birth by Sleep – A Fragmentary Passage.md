# Review

I can't stand anime for its naming. I don't know why people consider it acceptable. It's not and if people would just stand up for common decency, maybe we could live in a utopia world. Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep â€“ A Fragmentary Passage. A part of the Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue collection. Jesus christ.

Will review once have played.
