# Summary

Silent Hill is a survival horror game released in 1999 for the PS1. It was developed by Team Silent and published by Konami. In it, you play as Harry Mason searching for your daughter in the eponymous town of Silent Hill. Perhaps you've heard of it, maybe in a dream. But of course lo and behold we gotta deal with cults and monsters and all manner of scares once we get there.

I've long wanted to do some Silent Hill, at the very least the first two. I've never played or watched them before surprisingly, given the games and genres I'm interested in. It reminds me a bit of Twin Peaks. Where their influence is immense and everywhere and I like a lot of spinoff stuff that was directly inspired by said thing. I had just never seen the original. Obviously Silent Hill 2 is the big daddy of all psychological survival horror. Also that psychological aspect is well proper in my wheelhouse. But I wanted to start with the first one even if the psychological stuff isn't as much of a focus. Not like either is particularly long or anything and also the first one is perfectly well-regarded from what I've seen. We will eventually progress to the second game as well, I am sure. Not sure if I'll end up covering anything beyond those two, but we shall see.

# Review

Quite fun seeing the source of a number of references I recognized. Lots of stuff from [[Games/Signalis (2022)\|Signalis]].
