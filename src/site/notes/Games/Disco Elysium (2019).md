Unbelievable. My favorite game of all time. (I am *so* sorry [[Games/Outer Wilds (2019)\|Outer Wilds (2019)]]) I am still to this day in shock at how much this game was made for me. It is so goddamn hilarious. It is so Lynchian. It's so dark and real, but also so hopeful and bright. There's still time. Disco Elysium is *real*. And the worldbuilding?! Insane. Every detail is so delicious. I am at times *desperate* for any more information about this world and also *completely content* with the vignette we get of it through Harry's eyes. And isn't that so amazing too!? We are dealing with the biggest of human questions, but we never lose sight of the humanity at the core. The first death is in the heart, the second is at the credits.
