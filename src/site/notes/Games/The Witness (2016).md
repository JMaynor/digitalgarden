# Summary

# Review

The Witness left an indelible mark on all who were involved with it. Jonathon Blow continues to be used as a point of reference years after the fact. I quite liked the game, but its attitude does lend itself very well towards the persona of a demanding taskmaster. I kinda want to go back at some point and proper finish it, but I doubt I'd ever be able to convince Alex and Sam to come back for that. And doing that alone doesn't seem near as fun.
