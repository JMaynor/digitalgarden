# Summary

# Review

Very enjoyable story. Love the whole idea of getting to know a place over a period of many years. First act and third were a little slow at times, but the second in particular sped by like a good book. And the game *is* a good book. Even the visuals are certainly unique. I love how much love is evident in the game. Not a period of time I have any particular love for or care of, but I could feel the interest the authors had and that made me interested.
