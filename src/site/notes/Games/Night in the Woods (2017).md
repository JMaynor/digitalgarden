# Summary

# Review

Fun, though after having played [[Games/Pentiment (2022)\|Pentiment (2022)]], was a little bit lacking. Not through its own fault. Night in the Woods walked so Pentiment could run. It is what it is advertised as. A silly little animal slice of life with a patina of cosmicism and weirdoism.
