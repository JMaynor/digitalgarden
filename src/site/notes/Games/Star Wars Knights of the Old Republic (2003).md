# Summary

# Review

Thought it was fun while playing (though terribly terribly dated, controls were no good), but it suffers greatly from the hindsight comparisons drawn after playing [[Games/Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II (2004)\|KOTOR2]]. KOTOR1 is the Fallout 3 to KOTOR2's [[Games/Fallout New Vegas (2010)\|New Vegas]]. Obsidian is just a way more interesting company than Bioware when it comes to story and characters for me.
