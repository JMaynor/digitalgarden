# Summary

# Review

Thought it was fun while playing (though terribly terribly dated, controls were no good), but it suffers greatly from the hindsight comparisons drawn after playing KOTOR2. The Fallout 3 to KOTOR2's New Vegas. Obsidian is just a way more interesting company than Bioware when it comes to story and characters for me.
