# Summary

# Review

Wildly insane. Wish there was a bit more meat here. It's fun, but it has problems. I'm a big believer in weirdoism, but this one dips its toes a bit too much into the lolrandom puddle for my liking. It's a thin line, but an important one. It's what keeps us grounded and not flying away into Cloud Cuckooland. Things start to become meaningless then. I think that's the primarily problem here. There's nothing to grab onto. It's charming certainly, and the cast is colorful (literally). But nothing really means anything. I enjoyed the presentation. Very [[Games/Psychonauts (2005)\|Psychonauts (2005)]].
