# Summary

# Review

I liked it well enough. I felt that the gameplay got a bit same-y and I was ready to be done with it by the end. But I quite liked the visuals and was interested in what was going on. Didn't like some of the dialogue. Felt like it was being fed through google translate or something. There was some typos and strange word choice, that I would've liked if it had gotten a once-over.
