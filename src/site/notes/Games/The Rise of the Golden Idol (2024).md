# Summary

The Rise of the Golden Idol is a sequel to 2022's Case of the Golden Idol. It is developed by Color Gray Games and published by Playstack. The detective game has you solving a series of strange cases set in the 1970s. The idol is back and humans are as sinful as ever.

Very exciting and terrifying. I needed a break after Case of the Golden Idol to rest my weary mind, but we are now back and ready to go.
