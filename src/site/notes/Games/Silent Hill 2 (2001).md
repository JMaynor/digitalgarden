# Summary (WIP)

Silent Hill 2 is a survival horror game released in 2001 for the PS2. It was developed by Team Silent and published by Konami. You might have heard of it, being one of the most beloved games of all time and all that jazz. In it, you play as widower James Sunderland, who has returned to the town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter seemingly from his dead wife.

SH2 has been high on my list of To-Dos having never experienced the series until recently. I think I'm gonna have a recurring sort of subseries of let's plays. Best games of all time (that I haven't yet played). I'm quite excited, particularly after playing and enjoying the series' first iteration not long ago. Obviously, we're at the big one now. To address the elephant in the room, yes I'm super aware of the remake. I'm not averse to old games though, and so I want to experience the classic as it was originally intended first. Perhaps someday we will do the remake if it ends up being well-received and folks would like to see that. But for now, let's journey once again into the fog.
