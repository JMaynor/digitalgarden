# Review

I can see the complaints. I largely agree with them. I did still enjoy playing it, but it was marred by some important issues. Chief of which, I think, is the fact that there is no danger. The decision to have no limited resources whatsoever, nor have health or sanity made it to where there was no real sense that you were anything but completely safe the whole time. There were scary moments where something started chasing you. But it wasn't an omnipresent threat. I will however say, I loved the general atmosphere. I loved the feeling of being inside the machine. The industrial and mechanical grinding and steamworks that makes everything feel so harsh. Like this is a place no man should be in. That and the excellent narration being used to describe the surroundings.
