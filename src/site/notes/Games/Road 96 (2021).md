# Summary

# Review

Really enjoyed this one. I feel like it was more than the sum of its parts, it really stuck in my head. I love how wacko insane everyone is. Very fun. The one big negative I felt in the game is that you play as a number of different people, but as you cycle through them, there's no real sense of each of those people being a character. It's the people you're interacting with that are the real characters. Which is interesting, but it did feel a bit strange. Definitely not what most games do.
