# Summary

Norco is a point and click adventure game released in 2022 by Geography of Robots and published by Raw Fury. In it, you play as Kay, a woman who has returned to her home of Norco, Louisiana after the death of her mother. You become involved in the mysteries of your mother's investigations and your brother's disappearance.

The second in the batch of indie games I recently bought cuz of how interesting they looked. Loving the vibes of this one. The southern gothic mixed with the futurism is a great combo. It immediately pulled me in. I saw this one in particular as it was compared to Disco Elysium and Kentucky Route Zero, two particular favorites of mine.
