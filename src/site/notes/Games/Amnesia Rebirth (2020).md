# Summary

# Review

Interesting followup to Dark Descent. I played this one before getting around to Machine for Pigs later. I don't think that it was nearly as scary as Dark Descent, but it did have the standout maze sequence with the one guy who's half-transformed and coming after you. Very memorable and good. At the time, I found it quite interesting how much it advanced the plot of the overall series. In hindsight, however, I wonder if it advanced it too much. The series had largely been progressing linearly in time, until Rebirth. Then afterward Bunker went backwards. And I can see why given how this game ends. Wonder if perhaps they somewhat put themselves in a bit of a pickle.
