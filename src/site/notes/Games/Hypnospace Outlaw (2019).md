# Summary

Simulation sort of detective game where you play as a moderator for an incompetent tech company in an alternate 90s sort of internet called hypnospace.

# Review

Fun game full of heart. I did end up kinda rushing through the story, because I was ready to get through it. Not really an indictment on the game, more just I didn't wanna spend forever let's playing it. Has so much incidental detail that it felt almost a little overwhelming. Would have been more fun if I was just playing it in my own time and didn't have that self-enforced time limit.
