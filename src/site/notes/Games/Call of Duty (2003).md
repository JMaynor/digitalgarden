# Summary

# Review

Ended up being surprisingly fun. Was obviously quite dated by today's standards, but I didn't really mind. There was a couple instances of some frustration caused by confusion in what it was they were wanting from me. But I quite liked being a boogie woogie bugle boy. Enough that this would spawn a whole subseries of LPs.
