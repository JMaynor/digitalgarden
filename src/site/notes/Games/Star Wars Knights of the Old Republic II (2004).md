# Summary

# Review

Better in pretty much every way to KOTOR1 in my opinion. Again, it absolutely shows its age with the gameplay. It's a bit garbage to me. But I really like Obsidian's style of storytelling. To me pretty clearly superior to Bioware. The game's unfinished state is definitely annoying. I played a version of the game with the big mod that tries to fix a number of bugs and restore some of the unfinished bits. So I didn't get quite the normal KOTOR2 experience. But even with that, I could feel the last world was a bit thrown together. HK Factory was wretched, shoulda been playtested. I know that's hardly the responsible of the mod-makers but it was really really a slog. I would recommend not doing it, personally.
