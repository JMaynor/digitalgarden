# Summary

Puzzle game with some light Lovecraft elements (think more dreamlands, less Call of Cthulhu).

# Review

First game I LP'd. Was fun, not overly difficult so I don't recall there being any puzzles that tripped me up too bad. Could've been a lil bit longer, but at least didn't over stay its welcome.
