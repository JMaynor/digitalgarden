# Summary

# Review

I feel very conflicted about Control. Loved the worldbuilding, the details. But the gameplay really threw me for a loop. I felt it got so boring. I wish I hadn't done the DLC. I think that was really the breaking point for me. I just did not want to keep doing the moment-to-moment gameplay by then. I cranked the difficulty way down but by the time I was most of the way through the Alan Wake DLC and basically at the end. I think it would have helped if I had done that halfway through the main game. Although what I really want is just more incidence. More aspects of the game you're interacting with. Combat felt good but it was so simple and didn't meaningfully change once you get the flying.
