# Summary

Visual novel set in an Appalachian coal town where weirdo stuff is starting to happen.

# Review

Very fun game. Series is currently on hiatus. I've finished what's out thus far (episodes 1-4). Waiting for more to release, hopefully sometime this year. Will present a full review when complete. Don't want to make any final judgements until then.
